                            **6.08 Design Excersize 2: Weather**
									*Rohan Wagh*
For this design excersize, we were expected to design a clapper that turned on or off the 'lights' on a quick two claps.

Hardware Components:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This project used two components. The first is the ESP32 Microcontroller, which runs the program and communicates with the server. The second component is a screen, that is toggled by changing the background color. 

Software Structure:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The actual structure of each program is quite simple, based on a FSM and running average of audio input. The first 'step' of the program is to take in the audio input from the microphone and use a running average to get a less 'noisy' value. The running average runs with an order of 20, meaning in takes the last 20 readings into consideration. This results in a value representing the audio that typically lies within around 300 off of just background noise . From here the system willl take this value and threshold it to pull out only significant noises. This threshold is set to only consider valules above 350. If the signal is below 350, it gets a value of 0, while signals above 350 get a value of 1. This allows the system to pull out and simplify potential claps. 

The system also uses a FSM to keep track of claps and make sure the light only switches when the appropriate requirements are made. This FSM starts at an IDLE, which is the period where the screen remains at its value and has counted 0 claps. Once a value of 1 is recorded, it moves to the first wait. This wait will wait for CLAP_TIME milliseconds before rechecking the audio. If it's down to 0 then the clap is approved, if not, then it is likely continous noise and will drop down to IDLE. If approved it then moves on to the waiting for 2ndd clap stage. This stage is similar to the IDLE stage (waiting for claps), but with a count of 1 clap, and also drops down to IDLE after 1 second. If a audio is recorded, however, the FSM moves to wait 2, where after a CLAP_TIME wait, the system will recheck the audio. If the audio is still 1, it will drop down to waiting for second clap. If the audio is 0 and there was at least 0.25 secoonds between claps, the system willl toggle the screen, if not enough time the system will go to IDLE.

This FSM allows the clapper to avoid continous noise and incorrect times between claps, but not continous clapping. To avoid that, a 'cooldown' was implemented to wait for 500 ms after switching screens before runing the state machine. 

Code Appendix
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Here is some of the cooler aspects of the code:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ C++
if (millis()-just_changed_timer > 500) {//prevents spamming on off on off
    switch (state) {
      case IDLES:
        if (average == 1) {
          state = CLAP_ONE_WAIT;
          clap_timer = millis();
          time_between = millis();
        }
        break;
      case CLAP_ONE_WAIT:
        if (millis()-clap_timer > CLAP_TIME) {
          if (average == 1){
            state = IDLES;
          }
          else {
            state = WAIT_FOR_CLAP_TWO;
          }
        }
        break;
      case WAIT_FOR_CLAP_TWO:
        if (millis()-time_between > 1000) { //second has passed without clap
          state = IDLES;
        }
        if (average == 1) {
          state = CLAP_TWO_WAIT;
          clap_timer = millis();
        }
        break;
      case CLAP_TWO_WAIT:
        if (millis()-clap_timer > CLAP_TIME) {
          if (average == 1){
            state = WAIT_FOR_CLAP_TWO;
          }
          else {
            if (millis()-time_between > 250) {
              screen = -screen;
              if (screen == 1){
                tft.fillScreen(TFT_GREEN);
              }
              else{
                tft.fillScreen(TFT_BLACK);
              }
              state = IDLES;
            }
            else {//clap before 0.25 sec
              state = IDLES;
            }
          }
        }
        break;
    }
  }
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This is the FSM that controls counting buttons and adjusts screen if necesary. 

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ C++
float averaging_filter(float input, float* stored_values, int order, int* index) {
    // replace the input and update index
    if(*index>49) {
      *index = *index-50;
    }
    stored_values[*index] = input;
    // now go backwards from the index 
    float multi = 1/((float)(1+order));
    float sum = 0.0;
    for(int i = *index; *index-i < order+1; i--) {
      if (i < 0){
        sum += multi*(stored_values[50+i]);
      }
      else {
        sum += multi*(stored_values[i]);
      }
    }
    *index = *index + 1;
    return sum;
}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This is the average filter that keeps that 'rounds' the signals by checking the last ORDER numbe of values.
